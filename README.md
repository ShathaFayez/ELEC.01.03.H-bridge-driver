# ELEC.01.03.H-bridge-driver
Controlling 2 DC motor with an L293D(H bridge motor driver) and an Arduino. This is an implementation for two-wheel robot base.

The motors are programmed to simultaneously move clockwise for 2 seconds and then anticlockwise for another 2 seconds

There are 4 componants in this design (H-bridge l293, Arduino Uno R3, Breadboard, 2 DC Motors)

Result:
